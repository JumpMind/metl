This directory is automatically generated by Vaadin and contains the pre-compiled 
frontend files/resources for your project (frontend development bundle).

It should be added to Version Control System and committed, so that other developers
do not have to compile it again.

Frontend development bundle is automatically updated when needed:
- an npm/pnpm package is added with @NpmPackage or directly into package.json
- CSS, JavaScript or TypeScript files are added with @CssImport, @JsModule or @JavaScript
- Vaadin add-on with front-end customizations is added
- Custom theme imports/assets added into 'theme.json' file
- Exported web component is added.

If your project development needs a hot deployment of the frontend changes, 
you can switch Flow to use Vite development server (default in Vaadin 23.3 and earlier versions):
- set `vaadin.frontend.hotdeploy=true` in `application.properties`
- configure `vaadin-maven-plugin`:
```
   <configuration>
       <frontendHotdeploy>true</frontendHotdeploy>
   </configuration>
```
- configure `jetty-maven-plugin`:
```
   <configuration>
       <systemProperties>
           <vaadin.frontend.hotdeploy>true</vaadin.frontend.hotdeploy>
       </systemProperties>
   </configuration>
```
